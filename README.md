## Vulpes Minecraft Dart

This repository is part of the **Vulpes** project and contains various Minecraft data generated using a CLI tool written in Dart.
Not all data is included, as it is extracted from the [Minestom](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom) server software, and some data types are not yet supported.

### Important Notes

This project is automatically generated by the [Stelaris CLI](https://github.com/OneLiteFeatherNET/stelaris-cli) tool.
If you encounter bugs or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue in the **Stelaris CLI repository**, not here.

You are free to modify the generated data in your own fork. 
However, keep in mind that every time an update is released, you’ll need to manually merge your changes to stay up to date.
